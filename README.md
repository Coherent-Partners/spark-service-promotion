## Introduction

Explain briefly what this project is about and why the CI/CD pipeline is important for it.

## Workflow Description

Provide an overview of the CI/CD pipeline workflow, including its stages, steps, and what each step accomplishes.

Example:

- **Build**: This stage compiles and builds the project.
- **Test**: This stage runs automated tests to ensure code quality.
- **Deploy**: This stage deploys the application to the target environment.

## Getting Started

Explain how to set up and configure the CI/CD pipeline in a user's own repository.

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites or dependencies that users need to have before setting up the pipeline.

Example:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- Docker (if applicable)
- AWS account (if deploying to AWS)

### Setting up Secrets

If your pipeline requires any secret credentials or tokens, explain how users can set them up securely in their GitHub repository.

Example:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets` > `New repository secret`.
3. Add a new secret with the name `SECRET_NAME` and the corresponding value.

## Workflow Configuration

Explain how the workflow configuration file(s) are organized in the repository. Provide an overview of the key files and their purposes.

Example:

- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: Contains the main CI/CD workflow definition.

## Usage

Explain how users can trigger the CI/CD pipeline manually and what automated triggers are set up (e.g., on push, on pull request).

Example:

- To trigger the pipeline manually, click on the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository and select the workflow you want to run.

## Customizing the Workflow

Provide guidance on how users can customize the CI/CD pipeline to fit their specific needs. Include information on environment variables, configuration files, and any other customization options.

Example:

- To customize the deployment environment, modify the `ENVIRONMENT` variable in the workflow file.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to this project, including guidelines for pull requests, issues, and code style.

Example:

- We welcome contributions! Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.
